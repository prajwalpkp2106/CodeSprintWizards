# Stock Price Prediction and Fundamental Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains a machine learning solution for stock price prediction and fundamental analysis integrated into a user-friendly web interface using Streamlit. The project focuses on assisting investors in making informed decisions regarding stock investments by combining technical analysis (stock price prediction) and fundamental analysis.

## Features

- *Stock Price Prediction:*
  - Utilizes LSTM model for predicting stock prices based on historical data.
  - Provides visualizations of predicted prices against actual prices.
  
- *Fundamental Analysis:*
  - Displays real-time data visualization for fundamental analysis factors.
  - Incorporates various financial indicators for comprehensive analysis.

- *User Interface (UI):*
  - Developed using Streamlit for an interactive and intuitive user experience.
  - Sections include stock price prediction and fundamental analysis.
